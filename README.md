# Excursion Project

*Codecademy - Fullstack Engineer Path*

## Project Objectives: 
- Create a web page which advertises a product called 'Excursion'.
- Use my growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.

For this project, I decided to include a logo, a background image, and layout my web page in a different way compared to **[Codecademy Design Mock](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/mocks/excursion.png)**.This project was very fun because I came up with my own idea on how I felt the website should look like.
